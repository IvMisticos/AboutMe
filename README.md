# My achievements

I maintain some open-source projects.

## [Console](https://github.com/TheConsole/Console)

> I created this project to gather more experience with C#. It allows people to easily create hot-loadable plugins *(libraries)* with hooks *(events)*, commands, variables, logs, data-file system and other features.

## [dotBridge](https://github.com/dotbridge/)

> dotBridge is a collection of my projects for mainly social websites/applications API interaction, like Discord.

## [uMod Plugins](https://github.com/IvMisticos/uModPlugins)

> I make private and public plugins for uMod modification. Some of them are widely used and I am proud of it, because I try to improve this community by making plugins and helping people there.
